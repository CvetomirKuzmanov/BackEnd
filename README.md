# BackEnd

## This is one of the parts of the openAps/Nightscout widget for iphone

# It works by getting the entries from mongoDB, then sending it to the server and displaying it to the front-end.

## The second part is the widget itself that works by reading the information then displaying it every 10 minutes.
